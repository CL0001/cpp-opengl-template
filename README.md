# C++ OpenGL Template
This is a starter template for anyone learning OpenGL with C++, designed to eliminate the hassle of setting up dependencies manually.

If you're looking for detailed documentation to support your OpenGL learning journey, check out: https://docs.gl


## Requirements
* **C++ compiler** (like MSVC, GCC, Clang)
* **CMake** - CMake is a build system generator that simplifies the process of managing and building projects.


## Building and Running
This template includes simple test code to verify that everything is set up correctly. Use it as a starting point to build and run the project.

1. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
2. Generate project files with CMake:
```
cmake ..
```
3. Build the project:
```
cmake --build .
```
4. Run the application:
```
./Debug/OpenGL.exe
```

## Sample Result
If the build succeeds, you should see an orange triangle like this:
