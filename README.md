# C++ OpenGL Template
This is a starter template for anyone who wants to start learning OpenGL with C++. It provides a minimal and simple setup, so you can quickly dive into coding without the hassle of complex configurations.


## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/CL0001/cpp-opengl-template.git
```
Or, download the ZIP file and extract it.


## Requirements
* A C++ compiler (like MSVC, GCC, Clang)
* CMake
* GLFW (this template includes it)


## Building and Running
This template includes simple test code to ensure everything is working. You can use this as a basis to try the building and running process.

Navigate to the build directory:
```
cd build
```

Generate the project files using CMake:
```
cmake ..
```

Build the project:
```
cmake --build .
```

Run the application:
